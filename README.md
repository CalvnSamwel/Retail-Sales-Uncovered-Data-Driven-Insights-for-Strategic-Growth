# Retail-Sales-Uncovered-Data-Driven-Insights-for-Strategic-Growth ðŸ›’  

## **Project Overview** ðŸ“‘  
This project involved analyzing transactional retail data to extract key business insights, focusing on sales trends, customer behavior, and profitability. By leveraging SQL, we structured, cleaned, and explored retail sales data to identify patterns that inform business decisions. The dataset included critical financial metrics such as total sales, cost of goods sold (COGS), pricing data, and customer demographics.
